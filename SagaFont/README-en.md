# MFGA
> **This module achieves complete glyph coverage of all defined characters in ``Unicode Latest`` (including private use areas and supplementary private use areas) by combining multiple fonts [Font Sources & Licenses](https://github.com/Numbersf/MakeFontsGreatAgain/blob/main/LICENSES.md). ``Reserved`` symbols and undefined characters in private use areas will display their code information using ``ZUno-Number.ttf``**
 
> **This module can block ``GMS fonts`` through ``action.sh`` and the ``WebUI``, covering most ``GAPPS``. This feature conflicts with the ``PIF module`` (also partially depending on the mounting method), so please enable the uninstall module separately for ``Play Services and Store``, do not enable “default uninstall module”, and do not use the ``shamiko`` whitelist**
 
> **This module allows specifying ``ttf/otf`` font ranges to block, while leaving other areas effective**
 
> **This module allows you to directly modify the color of any symbol**
